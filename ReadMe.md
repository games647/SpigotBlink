# SpigotBlink

## Description

This project connects to [SpigotMc](https://www.spigotmc.org) (Xenoforo-Forum). If there are new unread notifications, it connects
to the [Blink1](https://blink1.thingm.com/) USB-device and starts blinking in orange like the forum color.

This project was created because there were no [ifttt.com](https://ifttt.com/) recipes for this.

## Setup

1. Get python3
2. Install dependencies
`pip install blink1`
3. Now you can run it with `python3 spigot_blink.py`
